== Abstract
[abstract]
A chunk of content that can be used where the abstract of the content needs to be displayed. 

== First Section
The abstract is a built-in role (called a style). When a built-in role is not available, a role can be used to pass the same type of information: 

.Block title
[[blockid]]
[quote, attribution="Abraham Lincoln", Soldiers' National Cemetery Dedication]
This is some section with title and id and attributes

[role="feature-list"] 
* lightweight 
* reusable 
* readable 
* etc... 

And not only can a role be assigned to a single paragraph, block or list, it can also be assigned to a sequence of content thanks to the open block. 

[role="lead"] 
-- 
Opening paragraph of the lead. 

Another lead paragraph. 

* topic 1 
* topic 2 
* topic 3 

Conclusion of the lead.
