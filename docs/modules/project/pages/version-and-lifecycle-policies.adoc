== 2.0.0 and Greater Version Policy

Asciidoctor will follow the {uri-semver}[semantic versioning] rules with the release of Asciidoctor.js 2.0.0.
Each Asciidoctor.js release will be versioned *major.minor.patch*.

Major::
Major releases occur when there are substantial changes in functionality or when new functionality breaks backwards compatibility.
Releases within the same major version number will maintain API compatibility.

Minor::
Minor releases add new features, improvements to existing features, and fixes that maintain backwards compatibility.
Only the latest major release will receive new features.

Patch::
Patch releases fix bugs and maintain backwards compatibility.
Only the latest minor release of the two latest major releases will receive patches.
Patch releases happen as needed depending on the urgency of the fix.

Pre-release::
Major and minor releases may include pre-release versions (major.minor.patch-alpha.n | -beta.n | -rc.n).
Once a release candidate (rc) has been thoroughly tested, the stable release will be published.
